Experiments in C Programming
============================

Just random little programs from my playing around with c.

Check out the individual subdirectories for more info.

The "helper" Script
-------------------

Type `source ./helpers` to get my `compile` function, it runs `gcc` with strict settings and writes binaries to `./bin`.

It will automatically append `.c` so leave it off, and it will create a file with the name of the script.

Usage: `compile script_base_name`

The "bin" Directory
-------------------

Put compiled binaries here. We ignore this directory in git.
