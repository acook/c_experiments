c_experiments
=============

Just random little programs from my playing around with c.

Check out the individually subdirectories for more info.

aliases
-------

`source ./aliases` to get my `compile` alias, it runs `gcc` with strict settings.

It also writes binaries to `./bin`.

bin
---

Put compiled binaries here. We ignore this directory in git.
